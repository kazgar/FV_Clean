# RegEx_Disc_CleanUp
RegEx Disc CleanUp is a python scrip that can be used for looking for files that match a regex pattern, sorting them in a directory based on the date, and creating a backup of those files in respective directories on your google drive. I'm using this script to take care of my Invoice, but it can be really used for anything that you can think of.

## Installation
Use the package manager pip/pipx to install necessary packages.
```bash
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
```
